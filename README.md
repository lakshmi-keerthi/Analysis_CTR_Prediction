# **Email Click-Through Rate (CTR) Prediction**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on predicting the **Click-Through Rate (CTR)** of email advertisements by analyzing customer and product data. The primary objective is to **optimize targeting strategies** and improve email campaign performance through the application of **machine learning models**.

## **Key Objectives**
- Predict **email click-through rates (CTR)** using historical data from customers and products.
- Identify **key drivers of email engagement** through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **correlation analysis**, and **feature selection**.
- Improve targeting strategies using **XGBoost** and other machine learning models.

## **Tools & Technologies**
- **Python**: Primary language for data analysis and machine learning model development.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.
- **XGBoost**: A powerful machine learning algorithm used for CTR prediction.
- **Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing, model evaluation, and performance metrics.

## **Workflow**
1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical customer and product data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Perform data wrangling, handle missing values, and convert categorical variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze trends, correlations, and identify key features affecting CTR.
4. **Feature Selection**: Use feature importance techniques to select the most relevant features for the model.
5. **Model Training**: Train the **XGBoost** model and evaluate performance using metrics like **AUC** and **F1-Score**.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Compare model performance and select the best-performing model.

## **Results**
The modelâ€™s predictions enabled the optimization of **email targeting strategies**, leading to a significant improvement in the **click-through rate (CTR)** and overall **campaign performance**.
